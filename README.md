# PwC-Switzerland-Virtual-Program
  I did a virtual internship with PwC Switzerland in association with forage. Here I did 3 tasks using PowerBI which were as follows:
  
* 1) Call Centre Trends

# Objective:
  To get data driven insights and an accurate overview of trends in customer and agent behaviour using visuals.

# Data Source:
  The dataset was provided by PWC and forage.

# Tools Used:
  Power BI( ETL Process )

# Tasks Performed:
  I started with first assessing the dataset then exporting the dataset into power bi. After that I did transformation part where I cleaned the data which is the most           important and time consuming work before starting any analysis. I changed the data types wherever required, deleted the blank entries and added a column. Finally I loaded     the cleaned data into power bi desktop where I created some measures and then using different visuals createdreated an interactive dashboard which will give all the           answers the call centre company needs.

# Final Dashboard:
