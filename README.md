# PwC-Switzerland-Virtual-Program
  I did a virtual internship with PwC Switzerland in association with forage. Here I did 3 tasks using PowerBI which were as follows:
  
  # Call Centre Trends

# Tools Used:
  Power BI( ETL Process )

# Tasks Performed:
  I started with first assessing the dataset then exporting the dataset into power bi. After that I did transformation part where I cleaned the data which is the most         important and time consuming work before starting any analysis. I changed the data types wherever required, deleted the blank entries and added a column. Finally I loaded   the cleaned data into power bi desktop where I created some measures and then using different visuals createdreated an interactive dashboard which will give all the         answers the call centre company needs.

# Final Dashboard:
