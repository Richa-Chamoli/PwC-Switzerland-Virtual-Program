Tools Used:
Power BI( ETL Process )

Tasks Performed:
I started with first assessing the dataset then exporting the dataset into power bi. After that I did transformation part where I cleaned the data which is the most important and time consuming work before starting any analysis. I changed the data types wherever required, deleted the blank entries and added a column. Finally I loaded the cleaned data into power bi desktop where I created some measures and then using different visuals createdreated an interactive dashboard which will give all the answers the call centre company needs.
